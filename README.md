# Company-Working-Summary-Generator
This is a very simple python program which can use for check summary of company employees' working details in one day.
In This program,
*You have to enter working hours of employees
After you entered your details
  You can see,
  *How many employees worked today
  *What is the most worked time and who did that
  *What is the least worked time and who did that
  *Average working hour in the day
  *Is this productive or not
I just started learning python so my program is very simple. As long as I learn python I will implement this program widely.
